<br>

This JavaScript project uses **_Express.js_** with **_PostgreSQL_** as a database to demonstrate a **RESTful** API. It was created as part of a one-week solo sprint during my time as a student on Northcoders' full-stack Software Development bootcamp, to consolidate knowledge around C.R.U.D functionality.

Although its original design has been for use with a news website, it has the versatility to be adapted to other projects such as blogs, forums and social media platforms. Within this repository is a demonstration of my proficiency in developing and implementing a user-centred API for content management and creation.

The API will also form the backend of a frontend project built with **_React.js_**. Its functionality covers managing news articles, users and comments. The user is able to
post, update and delete articles and comments - as well as vote/downvote on articles and comments as seen on sites such as Reddit.

Once finishing with the sprint and deploying/hosting the API, I have since refactored and modularised my project for each endpoint as well as utilising react router. These changes reflect my ability to write clean, well-structured code in an MVC pattern.
